# TrafficAnalysis

In this project, an analysis was performed to determine how different factors and weather conditions affected the number of traffic incidents in the City of Calgary.

The goal of this project was to gain hands-on experience using real data readily available from the City of Calgary, as well as popular Python data analysis libraries such as Pandas and NumPy. In addition to these libraries, data visualization experience was gained through the use of Folium, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

The report for this project can be viewed in the PDF of the ipynb file used during the data analysis and visualization.
